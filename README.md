# Overview

This is my configuration of the tools that I constantly use to work, this guide is a compilation of the step by step that I had to follow to have a comfortable and beautiful development environment. Also, fast and light, remember that each of these Tools have their own README if you do not understand how they work or to use them, I leave you a summary of their use and configuration in these files.
